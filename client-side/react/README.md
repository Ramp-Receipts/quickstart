# React sample

React sample is a simple React component called `Receipts.js`. It defines a simple two column JSX layout with receipt list on the left and customer information on the right side.

Things you need to take care after copying the file to your project (follow TODO comments in code):

- `moment` and `numeral` need to be installed
- `bootstrap` needs to be installed, or you need to modify CSS classes and JSX markup to match your layout
- Modify `rootUrl` if you are serving server-side code from a different (sub)domain
