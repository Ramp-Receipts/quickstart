# Angular sample

Angular sample is a simple Angular component defined in `receipts.component.ts`. The view is defined in `receipts.component.html`. It defines a simple two column layout with receipt list on the left and customer information on the right side.

Things you need to take care after copying the file to your project (follow TODO comments in code):

- `bootstrap` needs to be installed, or you need to modify CSS classes and HTML markup to match your layout
- Modify `rootUrl` if you are serving server-side code from a different (sub)domain
